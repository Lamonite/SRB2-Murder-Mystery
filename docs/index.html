			<h3>The interpretation of the famous multiplayer game in SRB2!</h3>
			<p>---=== Please nevermind this unfinished part ===---</p>
			<h3>About the gametype</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game is to detect and eliminate all <font color="red">Murderers</font> among the players before they kill everyone (sounds very familiar, right?). <font color="blue">Sheriffs</font> are given the task to prevent this genocide and protect all <font color="green">Innocents</font> from being murdered.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of each round you will recieve one of these 3 roles. As said, <font color="red">Murderers have to murder everyone</font>, <font color="blue">Sheriffs have to defend Innocents and eliminate Murderers</font> & <font color="green">Innocents have to hide from the killers but can also help in the investigation</font>.</p>
			<p>You can find more description with all the details inside the Add-On in <font color="orange">MMHELP</font> console command. Hope this introduction will make you understand the game more!<p>
