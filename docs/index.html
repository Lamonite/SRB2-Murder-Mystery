				<h3>The port of the famous multiplayer game in SRB2!</h3>
				<p>This project tries to make an SRB2 gametype similar to "Murder Mystery 2" on Roblox and make it feel like a Sonic game. The development originally started by Tedbasher3000 in February 2023 and continued by the SRB2MM_DEV team to this day. Even though the project is still in ALPHA state the game is pretty playable and can be hosted on public servers</p>
				<h3>Short introduction into the gameplay</h3>
				<p>The goal of this game is to detect and eliminate all <b><font color="#dc143c">Murderers</font></b> among the players before they kill everyone (sounds very familiar, right?). <b><font color="#1e90ff">Sheriffs</font></b> are given the task to prevent this genocide and protect all <b><font color="#32cd32">Innocents</font></b> from being murde#dc143c.</p>
				<p>At the beginning of each round you will recieve one of these 3 roles. As said, <b><font color="#dc143c">Murderers have to murder everyone</font></b>, <b><font color="#1e90ff">Sheriffs have to defend Innocents and eliminate Murderers</font></b> & <b><font color="#32cd32">Innocents have to hide from the killers but can also help in the investigation</font></b>.</p>
				<p>You can find more description with all the details inside the Add-On in <font color="orange">MMHELP</font> console command.<p>
