			<h3>The port of the famous multiplayer game in SRB2!</h3>
			<p>This project tries to make an SRB2 gametype similar to "Murder Mystery 2" on Roblox and make it feel like a Sonic game. The development originally started by Tedbasher3000 in February 2023 and continued by the SRB2MM_DEV team to this day. Even though the project is still in ALPHA state the game is pretty playable and can be hosted on public servers</p>
			<h3>Short introduction into the gameplay</h3>
			<p>The goal of this game is to detect and eliminate all <font color="red">Murderers</font> among the players before they kill everyone (sounds very familiar, right?). <font color="blue">Sheriffs</font> are given the task to prevent this genocide and protect all <font color="green">Innocents</font> from being murdered.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of each round you will recieve one of these 3 roles. As said, <font color="red">Murderers have to murder everyone</font>, <font color="blue">Sheriffs have to defend Innocents and eliminate Murderers</font> & <font color="green">Innocents have to hide from the killers but can also help in the investigation</font>.</p>
			<p>You can find more description with all the details inside the Add-On in <font color="orange">MMHELP</font> console command.<p>
