DIGITAL SOUNDTRACK
for SRB2 Murder Mystery add-on

This PK3 file adds digital music tracks for the SRB2 Murder Mystery add-on.
Adding this file to the game will not trigger the "Game Modified" state in SRB2 making
this add-on fully client-side (players are not required to have this file to join netgames)

NOTE: Posting music-only add-ons on the SRB2 Message Board (mb.srb2.org) is PROHIBITED!

===============================================
 HOW TO MAKE THE MUSIC ADD-ON FROM THIS SOURCE
===============================================
1. Create a new .ZIP archive
2. Add the contents of this folder to the archive WITHOUT THIS .TXT
3. Change the extension of the .ZIP file to .PK3
4. You have crafted the music add-on!

As long as the archive has ONLY MUSIC LUMPS (O_* and D_* prefixed lumps) the add-on will
not trigger "Game Modified" state in SRB2
