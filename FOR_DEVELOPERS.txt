Hello, you seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who tried to steal the code...
Still, I am glad you opened this file as well as just opened the PK3 in archiver.

This gametype is going to an OPEN ASSET project, but right now, while it is in BETA state,
you need our permission to modify it. I know sounds stupid but we want to make a quality
gametype project.

If you think to read or even change the LUAs of this gametype I should warn that I made
the code very compact and very often it is unreadable. Yeah, I am the programmer who
believes that "every byte counts" especially in interpreted programming languages such as LUA.
If you're blaming me for that desicion, go on, no one will care.

Now if you really want to modify this Add-On I'll explain what each file does here:

      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for some other objects such as dead bodies


I guess this is enough for you, other files are either textures or music (did you like my tree
art?)

If you're watching this from GitHub repository there is also a LUA called "customlang.lua" in
TOOLS directory. This is a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES (but displays everything in ASCII letters). I tried to make it clear how to
create custom language but if you have questions you can always PM me or ask us in MM_DEV discord
(or even GitHub). Guess I wrote everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can also use the code to study

Have a nice day,
