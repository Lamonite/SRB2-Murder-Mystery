Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From the command line:
	1) Add the game-type addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. From the in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	Do not omit " brackets in "Murder Mystery" because they are important here!

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple of Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MM_ABILITIES - Enable/Disable abilities applied by a player's skin. When Disabled, all skins have Sonic1-like abilities
		(spin jump (including Amy & Fang), sneaking (hold SPIN button to walk slower and leave no footmarks)).
		Enable this Variable to remove the ability limit. The default value is OFF;
	MM_CUSTOMSKINS - Enable/Disable custom skins/characters in a Murder Mystery game.
		WARNING: CUSTOM SKINS MAY NOT BE DESIGNED FOR THIS GAMETYPE, ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		The default value is OFF.
	MM_AFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. The default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled;
	MM_SPAM - Used for chat spam protection. How much time player have to wait before sending
	    the next message - measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MM_DEADLYMODE - Enable/Disable the mode where death by hazards (crush, spikes, drown) makes players DEAD
	MM_DUELMODE - Enable/Disable access to all weapons for Murderers during the Showtime Duel. The default value is OFF.
	MM_AUTOFIRE - Enable/Disable autofire for all weapons. The default value is ON.

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only for the host player and can be used to send a message to the
	    dead players as <~SERVER>.

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and the reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break              |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom characters/abilities    | Can be too OP and ruin the way  |
|                                | MM was meant to be played       |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create a mess on the screen.|
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay. |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------=+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about    |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.   |
|                                | Additionally, text may disappear|
|                                | on the screen entirely          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Watch what you're adding, AND TRY TO NOT ADD CUSTOM CHARACTERS (they are disabled in MM anyway)!
