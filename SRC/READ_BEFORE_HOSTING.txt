Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From the command line:
	1) Add the game-type addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. From the in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	Do not omit " brackets in "Murder Mystery" because they are important here!

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple of Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MM_ABILITIES - Enable/Disable abilities applied by a player's skin. When Disabled, all skins have Sonic1-like abilities
		(spin jump (including Amy & Fang), sneaking (hold SPIN button to walk slower and leave no footmarks)).
		Enable this Variable to remove the ability limit. The default value is NO;
	MM_CUSTOMSKINS - Allow custom skins/characters in a Murder Mystery game.
		WARNING: CUSTOM SKINS MAY NOT BE DESIGNED FOR THIS GAMETYPE, ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		The default value is NO.
	MM_CHATDELAY - Used for chat spam protection. Sets how much time player has to wait before sending
	    the next message - measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MM_NOCAMPING - Enable/Disable the kicks for Emerald Camping. Murderers who are camping on the \x84Sheriff's Emerald\x80
		for longer than 30 seconds will be kicked. The default value is ON.
	MM_AFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. The default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled;
	MM_TEAMVIEW - Allow/Disallow teammate players to see each other's viewpoint (with F12). The default value is YES (Allow).
	MM_NOGUNS - Select one of the Knife-only modes. When set to 1, Murderers, Sheriffs and Heroes are limited only to Knife,
		but get access to all of the weapons when the Showdown Duel statrs. When set to 2, Only the knife is present throughout the whole game.
		Set to 0 to make the weapons act like normal. The default value is 0.
	MM_DUELMODE - Enable/Disable access to all weapons for Murderers during the Showtime Duel. The default value is ON.
	MM_AUTOFIRE - Enable/Disable autofire for all weapons. The default value is ON.

	    dead players as <~SERVER>.

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and the reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break              |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom characters/abilities    | Can be too OP and ruin the way  |
|                                | MM was meant to be played       |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create a mess on the screen.|
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay. |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------=+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about    |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.   |
|                                | Additionally, text may disappear|
|                                | on the screen entirely          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
