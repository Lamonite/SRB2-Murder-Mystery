Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their own server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From command line:
	1) Add the gametype addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. From in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	Do not ommit " brackets in "Murder Mystery" because they are important here!

---=== MM scripts that can break your hosted game ===---
This gametype features some scripts that can noticably change your game. Some of those can
improve the game stability (like fix the leaving chatbug) while others can break it (with
modified characters). The Add-On features the "Shut Up chatbug!" script made by Jisk. It is
DISABLED BY DEFAULT but you can control how "Shut Up Chatbug!" works with the console
variables described in the next chapter (their prefix is acb_)

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MMSPRINT - Turn sprinting on/off. When it's on you can use sprinting by holding CUSTOM1
	    button. If both MMSPRINT and MMCHARMODE are disabled Sneaking will be enabled instead.
	    Your character will sneak when you hold the SPIN button and you're on ground
		(a message on HUD appears when you're sneaking);
	MMCHARMODE - Switch between two Character Abbility modes. The one used on by default is
	    "Everyone is the same (regular persons)" mode. This is very similar to Sonic 1
		abbilities - all characters have only jump (Amy and Fang are using rolling jump state)
		that can be used to break monitors and get through some obstacles. The speed of the
		is also lowered. Second mode is "Vanilla Abilities in limited form". As the name
		applies all vanilla characters recieve their abbilities back but they are limited or
		cut versions of the original abilities they have;
	MMAFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. Default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled;
	MMSPAM - Used for chat spam protection. How much time player has to wait before sending
	    the next message. Measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MMSEMJ - Enable/Disable Sound Emojis (default values is "On")
	ACB_TOGGLE - Enable/Disable "ShutUp Chatbug!" script. Disabled by default. If it constantly
	    kicks your players while being enabled it's better to disable it and not use again.
	ACB_UPDATERATE - How constantly player will update their status, measured in ticks.
	    Default is 35 ticks.
	ACB_RESETRATE - How constantly server will check the statuses. When check fails
	    problematic player will be kicked. Default is 70 ticks.
	ACB_SHOWDEBUG - Print console messages when player status updates. Works localy.
	    Default is OFF.

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only in Dedicated Servers and only host can be use it.
	    The command itself is similar to SAY bu will print a message to the dead chat as it
		was sent by <~SERVER>. INPORTANT NOTE: message must be enclosed in " brackets otherwise
		only the first word will be sent!
		Usage example: SAYDEAD "Hello world!"

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break             |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom characters (with LUA)   | Can be too OP or custom MM     |
|								 | abbilities won't work at all.  |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom character (vanilla      | MM maps can be unplayable,     |
| chars SOC patch)               | depending on patch type.       |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create mess on the screen. |
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay.|
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| LUA (Custom abbilities)        | Can break the way MM was       |
|                                | intended to play. Also can     |
|                                | break internal MM abbility     |
|                                | system.                        |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about   |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.  |
|                                | Additionaly, text may dissapear|
|                                | entirely after those erros     |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
Basically watch what you're adding AND NEVER ADD CUSTOM CHARACTERS!
