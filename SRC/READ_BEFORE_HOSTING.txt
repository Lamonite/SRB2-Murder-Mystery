Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their own server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From command line:
	1) Add the gametype addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. From in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	Do not ommit " brackets in "Murder Mystery" because they are important here!

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MMSPRINT - Turn sprinting on/off. When it's on you can use sprinting by holding CUSTOM1
	    button. If both MMSPRINT and MMCHARMODE are disabled Sneaking will be enabled instead.
	    Your character will sneak when you hold the SPIN button and you're on ground
		(a message on HUD appears when you're sneaking);
	MMCHARMODE - Switch between three Character Abbility modes. Possible values for this
		variable are:
		0 - "Everyone is the same (regular persons)". This is very similar to Sonic 1
			abbilities - all characters have only jump (Amy and Fang are using rolling jump state)
			that can be used to break monitors and get through some obstacles. The speed of the
			characters is also lowered;
		1 - "Vanilla Abilities in limited form". As the name applies all vanilla characters
			recieve their abbilities back but they are limited or cut versions of the original
			abilities they have;
		2 - "Original Vanilla Abilities". In this mode all skin limits are removed. Same as if
			playing in vanilla SRB2 gametypes;
	MMAFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. Default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled;
	MMSPAM - Used for chat spam protection. How much time player has to wait before sending
	    the next message. Measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MMSEMJ - Enable/Disable Sound Emojis (default values is "On")

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only in Dedicated Servers and only host can be use it.
	    The command itself is similar to SAY bu will print a message to the dead chat as it
		was sent by <~SERVER>. INPORTANT NOTE: message must be enclosed in " brackets otherwise
		only the first word will be sent!
		Usage example: SAYDEAD "Hello world!"

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break             |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom characters (with LUA)   | Can be too OP or custom MM     |
|								 | abbilities won't work at all.  |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom character (vanilla      | MM maps can be unplayable,     |
| chars SOC patch)               | depending on patch type.       |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create mess on the screen. |
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay.|
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| LUA (Custom abbilities)        | Can break the way MM was       |
|                                | intended to play. Also can     |
|                                | break internal MM abbility     |
|                                | system.                        |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about   |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.  |
|                                | Additionaly, text may dissapear|
|                                | entirely after those erros     |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
Basically watch what you're adding AND TRY TO NOT ADD CUSTOM CHARACTERS (they'll be useless anyway)!

We will add more information here if something else important will be noticed,
please inform us as well if you will notice ANY KIND of bug/issue first.
