Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their own server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. To launch this gametype from command line you'll need to 
	1) Add the gametype addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_pk3]" parameter
	2) Write name of the gametype to launch that looks like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	   You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you'll have to use "-WARP MAPK0" to start in MM maps

	The final command line should look like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_pk3_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. To launch from game console use
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	NOTE: " brackets usage with "Murder Mystery" is very important!

---=== Things MM modify at your game ===---
This gametype features some code for improving game stability. It is mostly Chatbug and desynch fixes. The Add-On features code from "Shut Up chatbug!" (by Jisk) and "Intermission lock" (by Krabs). It is DISABLED BY DEFAULT but you can control how "Shut Up Chatbug!" works with the console variables
described in the next chapter (their prefix is acb_)

The gametype also features Language translation system that translates the MM content to given language with MMLANG command. When you use this command to
change your MM language code that handles it will save a file in location /luafiles/client/MM.DAT the information about your language. MM uses this file
when player is joining the server to load his prefered language. This file is saved localy for each player when they use this command.
One last important thing to know is that MM uses a fork of Modern Sonic's footstep sounds system for the gameplay (that's why you can notice huge list of
Sounds allocated on add-on loading log). It is highly cut and modified version of the original.

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MMSPRINT - Turn sprinting on/off. Can be used by holding CUSTOM1 button. If MMSPRINT and MMCHARMODE are disabled Sneaking will be instead enabled.
		It is useful with SPIN button (a HUD message appears when you use it)
	MMCHARMODE - Toggle between two Character Abbility modes. One turned on by default is "Everyone are the same (regular persons)" mode. This is very
		similar to Sonic 1 abbilities. All characters have only spinning jump (Amy and Fang too) that can break monitors. Their speed is also lowered.
		Second mode is "Vanilla Abbilities in limited form". As the name applies all vanilla characters recieve their abbilities back but they are
		limited or cut versions of the original.
	MMAFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. Default value is 2 minutes. If set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled.
	MMSPAM - Used for chat spam protection. How much time player has to wait before his next message sending. Measured in ticks (default 35)
	ACB_TOGGLE - Turn "ShutUp Chatbug!" script to fork. Default is OFF.
	ACB_UPDATERATE - How constantly player will update their status, measured in ticks. Default is 35 ticks.
	ACB_RESETRATE - How constantly server will check the statuses. When check fails problematic player will be kicked. Default is 70 ticks.
	ACB_SHOWDEBUG - Print console messages when player updates. Works localy. Default is OFF.
COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - Command for Dedicated Server host only. This will print a message to the dead chat as it was sent from <~SERVER>. NOTE: the message must
	be enclosed in " brackets otherwise only the first word will be sent! Usage example: SAYDEAD "Hello world!"

---=== IMPORTANT SERVER-SIDE SETTINGS ===---
THIS IS NOT A JOKE CHAPTER, TAKE IS SERIOUSLY

There is an important vanilla CVAR that can break Murder Mystery if its value is different from MM recomended:

"rejointimeout" DISABLED (set to 0 or "off") - if this variable is enabled MM will not start AT ALL.
Instead you are going to be constantly notified to disable this CVAR both in console and in gameplay (no one can skip it here).

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break             |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom characters (with LUA)   | Can be too OP or custom MM     |
|								 | abbilities won't work at all.  |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Custom character (vanilla      | MM maps can be unplayable,     |
| chars SOC patch)               | depending on patch type.       |

|                                | Not much critical for MM.      |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| LUA (stability impove/bug      | MM has some game stability     |
| fix of the SRB2)               | LUAs already implemented such  |

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
| LUA (Custom abbilities)        | Can break the way MM was       |
|                                | intended to play. Also can     |
|                                | break internal MM abbility     |
|                                | system.                        |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+
