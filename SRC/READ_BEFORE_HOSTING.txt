Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their own server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From the command line:
	1) Add the gametype addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype "Murder Mystery"
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype "Murder Mystery" -warp MAPK0

B. From the in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE "Murder Mystery"
	Do not omit " brackets in "Murder Mystery" because they are important here!

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple of Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MMSPRINT - Turn sprinting on/off. When it's on you can use sprinting by holding CUSTOM1
	    button. If both MMSPRINT and MMCHARMODE are disabled Sneaking will be enabled instead.
	    Your character will sneak when you hold the SPIN button and you're on the ground
		(a message on HUD appears when you're sneaking);
	MMCHARMODE - Switch between three Character Ability modes. Possible values for this
		variable is:
		0 - "Everyone is the same (regular persons)". This is very similar to Sonic 1
			abilities - all characters have only jump (Amy and Fang are using rolling jump state)
			that can be used to break monitors and get through some obstacles. The speed of the
			characters are also lowered;
		1 - "Vanilla Abilities in the limited form". As the name applies all vanilla characters
			receive their abilities back but they are limited or cut versions of the original
			abilities they have;
		2 - "Original Vanilla Abilities". In this mode, all skin limits are removed. Same as if
			playing in vanilla SRB2 gametypes;
	MMAFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. The default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled;
	MMSPAM - Used for chat spam protection. How much time player have to wait before sending
	    the next message - measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MMSEMJ - Enable/Disable sound from Chat Sound Emojis (default value is "On")

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only for the host player and can be used to send a message to the
	    dead players as <~SERVER>.

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and the reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break              |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom characters (with LUA)   | Can be too OP or custom MM      |
|                                | abilities won't work at all.    |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom character (vanilla      | MM maps can be unplayable,      |
| chars SOC patch)               | depending on patch type.        |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create a mess on the screen.|
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay. |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| LUA (Custom abilities)         | Can break the way MM was        |
|                                | intended to play. Also can      |
|                                | break internal MM ability       |
|                                | system.                         |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------=+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about    |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.   |
|                                | Additionally, text may disappear|
|                                | on the screen entirely          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
Basically, watch what you're adding, AND TRY TO NOT ADD CUSTOM CHARACTERS (they'll be useless anyway)!

We will add more information here if something else important will be noticed,
please inform us as well if you will notice ANY KIND of bug/issue first.
