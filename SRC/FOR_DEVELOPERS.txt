Greetings, you seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who tries to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

This gametype is going to an OPEN ASSET project but right now, while it is in the BETA state,
you need our permission to modify it. I know sounds stupid but we want to make a quality
add-on.

Please note that the code is often very compact and may be unreadable for 'untrained eyes'. 

Now if you really want to modify this Add-On I'll explain what each file does here:

MM_MurderMystery_[x.x-BETA].pk3
|
+-LUA-\
|     |
|     +--MAIN--\
|     |        +-ABBILITIES.LUA - Responsible for character abbilities
|     |        +-CHAT.LUA - controls CHAT
|     |        +-CCMD.LUA - MMHELP and MMLANG commands
|     |        +-GAME.LUA - Main core of the game logic, everything usually happen here
|     |        +-HUD.LUA - HUD renderer
|     |        \-NOCHEAT.LUA - Responsible for your game closing on rename
|     |
|     +--MISC--\
|     |        \-ASSETS.LUA - All other open assets used in this gametype (heavily modified)           
|     |
|     \--INIT.LUA-- Init, all text, .PK3 properties (such as devbuild or not) and objects
|
\-SOC-\
      +-MAINCFG.TXT - SOC for maps
      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for some other objects such as dead bodies


Other files are either textures or music and don't need to be listed here (I guess)

If you're watching this from GitHub repository there is also a LUA called "customlang.lua" in
TOOLS directory. This is a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES (but displays everything in ASCII letters). I tried to make it clear how to
create custom language but if you have questions you can always PM me or ask us in MM_DEV discord
(or even GitHub). Guess I wrote everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can also use my code to study

Have a nice day,
