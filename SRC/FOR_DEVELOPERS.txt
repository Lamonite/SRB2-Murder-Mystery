Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who tries to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

If you're reading this file from GitHub this is great - you have more content to work with 

Now if you really want to modify this Add-On let me introduce you to our file structure:

MM_MurderMystery_[x.x-BETA].pk3
|
+-LUA-\
|     |
|     +--MAIN--\
|     |        +-ABILITIES.LUA - Responsible for character abbilities
|     |        +-CHAT.LUA - controls CHAT
|     |        +-CCMD.LUA - MMHELP and MMLANG commands
|     |        +-GAME.LUA - Main core of the game logic, everything usually happen here
|     |        +-HUD.LUA - HUD renderer
|     |        \-NOCHEAT.LUA - Responsible for your game closing on rename (thank me later)
|     |
|     +--MISC--\
|     |        \-ASSETS.LUA - All third-party open assets used in this gametype (heavily modified)
|     |
|     \--INIT.LUA-- Init, freeslot, all text, .PK3 properties (such as devbuild or not) and objects
|
\-SOC-\
      +-MAINCFG.TXT - SOC for maps
      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for custom objects such as dead bodies

Other files are either textures or music and don't need to be listed here (I guess)

As I said ealier you have more code if you're watching this from the GitHub repository. There is 
an additional LUA file called "customlang.lua" in the ASSETS/ directory of the repository. This is
a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
(but displays everything in ASCII letters). I tried to make it clear how to create custom
language but if you have questions about it you can always PM me or ask us in our MM_DEV Discord
(or even GitHub). Guess that's everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can also use our code to study

Have a nice coding!
