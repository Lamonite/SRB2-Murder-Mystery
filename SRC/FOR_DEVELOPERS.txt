Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who's trying to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

As I've said earlier, the GitHub repository has more content to work with such as an additional LUA file
in the repository called "customlang.lua" in the TEMPLATES/ folder. This is a template file for custom translations.
Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS TRANSLATIONS. I tried my best to make the tutorial about languages in that template
understandable but if you have questions you can always ask us in our MM_DEV Discord (or even on GitHub).

If you're new to the LUA you can freely use our code for educational purposes

Have a nice modding!
