Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who's trying to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

If you're reading this file from GitHub this is great - you have more content to work with 

Now, if you really want to modify this Add-On let me introduce you to our file structure:

MM_MurderMystery_[x.x-BETA].pk3
|
+-DOCS-\
|      +-List_of_Func_and_Const.md - Documentation of functions and constants
|      \-MM_String_Format.md - Documentation of "Murder Mystery string format"
|
+-LUA-\
|     |
|     +--MAIN--\
|     |        +-ABILITIES.LUA - Responsible for character abbilities
|     |        +-CCMD.LUA - MMHELP and MMLANG commands
|     |        +-CHAT.LUA - controls CHAT
|     |        +-DEBUG.LUA - This script is used only in Debug Builds of MM
|     |        +-FUNCTIONS.LUA - Function definitions for the rest of the source code
|     |        +-GAME.LUA - Main core of the game logic, everything usually happen here
|     |        +-HUD.LUA - HUD renderer

|     |        \-WEAPONS.LUA - Weapons code
|     |
|     +--MISC--\
|     |        \-FOOTSTEPS.LUA - Modified ModernSonic's footsteps engine
|     |
|     \--INIT.LUA-- Init, freeslot, add-on PK3 properties (such as devbuild or not) and some objects
|
\-SOC-\
      +-MAINCFG.TXT - SOC for maps
      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for custom objects such as dead bodies

Other files are either textures or music and do not need to be introduced here (I hope)

As I've said ealier you have more content if you're watching this from the GitHub repository.
There is an additional LUA file in repository called "customlang.lua" in the TEMPLATE/ folder.
This is a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS TRANSLATIONS. I tried my best
to make the tutorial about languages in that template understandable but if you have questions you can
always send a PM to me or ask us in our MM_DEV Discord (or even on GitHub). Guess I noted everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can freely use our code for study

Have a nice modding!
