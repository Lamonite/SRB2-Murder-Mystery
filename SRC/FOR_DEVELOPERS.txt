Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who's trying to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

If you're reading this file from GitHub this is great - you have more content to work with 

Now, if you really want to modify this Add-On let me introduce you to our file structure:

MM_MurderMystery_[x.x-BETA].pk3
|
+-DOCS-\
|      \-List_of_Func_and_Const.md - Documentation of functions and constants
|
+-LUA-\
|     |
|     +--MAIN--\
|     |        +-ABILITIES.LUA - Responsible for character abbilities
|     |        +-CCMD.LUA - MMHELP and MMLANG commands
|     |        +-CHAT.LUA - controls CHAT
|     |        +-FUNCTIONS.LUA - Function used in MM
|     |        +-GAME.LUA - Main core of the game logic, everything usually happen here
|     |        +-HUD.LUA - HUD renderer
|     |        \-NOCHEAT.LUA - Responsible for your game closing on rename (thank me later)
|     |
|     +--MISC--\
|     |        \-FOOTSTEPS.LUA - Modified ModernSonic's footsteps engine
|     |
|     \--INIT.LUA-- Init, freeslot, all text, .PK3 properties (such as devbuild or not) and some objects
|
\-SOC-\
      +-MAINCFG.TXT - SOC for maps
      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for custom objects such as dead bodies

Other files are either textures or music and don't need to be listed here (I guess)

As I've said ealier you have more content if you're watching this from the GitHub repository.
There is an additional LUA file in gitHub repository called "customlang.lua" in the ASSETS/ folder.
This is a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS
(but displays everything in ASCII letters). I tried my best to make the tutorial about languages in
that template understandable but if you have questions about it you can always PM me or ask us in
our MM_DEV Discord (or even on GitHub). Guess I noted everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can freely use our code to study

Have a nice modding!
