Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who's trying to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

If you're reading this file from GitHub this is great - you have more content to work with 

Now, if you want to modify this Add-On let me introduce you to our file structure:

MM_MurderMystery_[x.x-ALPHA].pk3
|
+-DEV_DOCS-\
|          +-List_of_Func_and_Const.md - Documentation of functions and constants
|          \-MM_String_Format.md - Documentation of "Murder Mystery string format"
|
+-LUA-\
|     |
|     +--MAIN--\
|     |        +-ABILITIES.LUA - Responsible for character abilities
|     |        +-CCMD.LUA - MMHELP and MMLANG commands
|     |        +-CHAT.LUA - Chat management & Chat sound effects
|     |        +-DEBUG.LUA - This script is used only in Debug Builds of MM
|     |        +-FUNCTIONS.LUA - Function definitions for the rest of the source code
|     |        +-GAME.LUA - The main core of the game logic, everything usually happens here
|     |        +-HUD.LUA - HUD renderer
|     |        +-TEXT.LUA - All text and its translations used in MM
|     |        \-WEAPONS.LUA - Recreation of the Vanilla Weapon Rings
|     |
|     +--MINIGAMES--\
|     |             +-HUD_MINIGAMES.LUA - Dedicated HUD renderer for the minigames
|     |             +-MINIGAME.LUA - Main logic code for "PONG" and "SONIC RUN" minigames
|     |
|     +--MISC--\
|     |        \-FOOTSTEPS.LUA - Modified ModernSonic's footsteps engine
|     |
|     \--INIT.LUA-- Init, freeslot, add-on PK3 properties (such as devbuild or not), and some objects
|
\-SOC-\
      +-MAINCFG.TXT - SOC for maps
      \-OBJCTCFG.TXT - SOC for some custom objects such as dead bodies

Other files are either textures or music and do not need to be introduced here (I hope)

As I've said earlier you have more content if you're watching this from the GitHub repository.
There is an additional LUA file in the repository called "customlang.lua" in the TEMPLATE/ folder.
This is a template file for custom translations. Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS TRANSLATIONS. I tried my best
to make the tutorial about languages in that template understandable but if you have questions you can
always send a PM to me or ask us in our MM_DEV Discord (or even on GitHub). Guess I noted everything important...

If you're new to the LUA you can freely use our code to study

Have a nice modding!
