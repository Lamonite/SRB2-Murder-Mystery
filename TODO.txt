- Spectator's bobbing (and momentum sometimes) doesn't disappear (unable to fix?)
- Rework/remake the "BACKROOMS"
- Make a logo
- Make some kind of background for "Sonic Run"
- Create at least 5 more maps (to make 15 in total)
- Update translations
- Try to not let multiple players spawn in one spot
- Change the titlecard and intermission backgrounds (to contain the name of the gametype)
